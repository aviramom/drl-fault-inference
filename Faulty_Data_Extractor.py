    """
    Identifies and returns faulty (state, action, next_state) transitions in a single trajectory.

    A tuple is considered faulty if executing the action in the recorded pre-state does not
    result in the expected post-state (as recorded in the trajectory). This usually happens
    due to an injected fault that alters the agent's behavior.

    Parameters:
        domain_name (str): Name of the Gym environment (e.g., "CartPole-v1").
        render_mode (str): Rendering mode for the Gym environment (e.g., "rgb_array" or None).
        trajectory (list): A single trajectory containing observations and actions as returned
                           by the simulator, typically a list of (obs, action) pairs.

    Returns:
        list of tuples: A list of faulty transitions (state, action, next_state), where the
                        observed transition did not match the environment's prediction under
                        the intended action.
